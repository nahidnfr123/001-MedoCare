            'description' => '<p>The British Heart Foundation (BHF) has recently launched a new single &pound;30 million research award:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bhf.org.uk/bigbeatchallenge">&lsquo;The Big Beat Challenge&rsquo;</a>. This challenge aims to fund &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s greatest minds tackling the world&rsquo;s biggest killers&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The BHF is already the largest independent charity funder of cardiovascular research in the U.K, and is hoping with this substantial award to fund research that creates big change and accelerates real progress.</p>

<p>This new award differs from the currently offered BHF funding streams in three main ways. Firstly, the challenge is open to international applicants and does not require a UK applicant to be part of the team. Secondly, the award is open to any domain, not just cardiovascular researchers hoping to appeal to teams utilising different skills and technologies. Thirdly, any aspect of heart or circulatory disease can be addressed by the challenges as long as there is a clear route to patient benefit.</p>

<p>Applications will need to be innovative, aiming for transformative rather than incremental gains. Teams will need to be highly collaborative and multi-disciplinary with a proposal that can justify this scale of funding. The project needs to be milestone-led, with a willingness to engage with BHF supporters.</p>

<p>Outline proposals can be submitted via the BHF website from December 2018. Following a review by an international advisory panel, shortlisted teams will be invited to submit full applications. Seed funding and advisory panel input will be made available at this time to further develop the proposals.</p>

<p>The winner of the challenge will be announced in the Spring of 2020.</p>

<p>Further details can be&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/bmjpodcasts/the-big-beat-challenge-from-the-british-heart-foundation?in=bmjpodcasts/sets/heart-podcast">heard in the Heart podcast</a>&nbsp;with Professor Nilesh Samani, Medical Director of the BHF, and also&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bhf.org.uk/bigbeatchallenge">on the BHF website</a>.</p>

            'description' => '<p><strong>Vector-Borne Diseases (VBDs)</strong>&nbsp;such as malaria, yellow fever, Lyme disease, plague, dengue, and leishmaniasis kill 700,000 people globally each year. Currently, the burden of VBDs is mostly found under tropical and warm climates that allow transmission all year long. This may change as our planet warms.&nbsp;<a href="https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-019-0565-1">Florence Fouque and her colleagues</a>&nbsp;examine the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases.</p>

<p>Vector-Borne Diseases (VBDs) are so called because they are not communicable directly between humans but through arthropod vectors, and all together they account for about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/vector-control/publications/global-control-response/en/">17% of infectious diseases</a>.</p>

<p>Insects and ticks that represent most of the vectors of the VBDs are not capable of regulating their own body temperature, so they are linked to very specific climatic conditions for all their bionomics, as well as their geographical distribution. Consequently, the effect of the changes in the weather and climatic conditions will affect strongly and directly the vectors and the transmission patterns of the pathogens.</p>

<p>Evidence of the impact of temperature and rainfall changes as well as occurrences of extreme climatic events are already available for many diseases and can be found in&nbsp;<a href="https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40249-019-0565-1">our article</a>&nbsp;published in&nbsp;<a href="https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/"><em>Infectious Diseases of Poverty</em></a>. The interventions and policies required at the international and national levels to mitigate climate change are well developed elsewhere and most countries are already engaged in specific actions to face the&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA72/A72_15-en.pdf">impact of climate change on Public Health</a>.</p>

<p>However, in many situations the epidemics and deadly consequences of these changes on the health of the human populations exposed can be prevented and controlled through adequate policies and interventions and countries can develop tools for surveillance and preparedness. Further, the knowledge on the mechanisms of transmission and the impact of climate change on VBDs can also be supported through strong global and national research programs.</p>',

            'description' => '<p><strong>Signs Of A Heart Attack May Differ In Men and Women</strong><br />
It&acirc;&euro;&trade;s critical to recognize that signs of a heart attack may differ in women. In addition to the typical symptom of chest pain a heart attack; women experience other atypical symptoms more frequently than men. This has led to many disparities in care over the years and there is now a strong movement to educate both healthcare providers and patients to be vigilant to this. Whereas men may more frequently experience chest pain as a sign of a heart attack, women may experience back pain, jaw pain, neck pain, nausea, shortness of breath, palpitations, indigestion, dizziness, and passing out.</p>

<p><strong>Signs of a Heart Attack &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Chest Pain That May Radiate</strong><br />
Chest pain is the most common and classic sign of a heart attack. It is often poorly localized, but is classically in the area behind the breastbone and associated with a pressure like sensation. The pain may radiate to the neck and jaw and the arms, the left arm most classically with a squeezing like sensation. These symptoms are known as angina. In stable angina these symptoms will often occur with exertion or emotional distress and go away with rest. If the symptoms last more than a few minutes then the diagnosis is certainly not considered stable angina and help should be sought.</p>

<p><strong>Signs of a Heart Attack &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Sweating</strong><br />
The medical term for sweating here is diaphoresis, a well-known sign of a heart attack. This occurs due to activation of a defense mechanism known as the sympathetic nervous system, a kind of fight or flight response. The sweating may occur with or without chest pain, and may occur with other non-chest pain symptoms in a heart attack such as arm pain, jaw pain, shortness of breath and such.</p>

<p><strong>Signs of a Heart Attack &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Shortness of Breath</strong><br />
In addition to the symptoms mentioned above, or on its own, shortness of breath is well recognized when it comes to signs of a heart attack. This occurs as a manifestation of heart failure caused by heart muscle dysfunction from the heart attack.</p>

<p><strong>Signs of a Heart Attack &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Passing out</strong><br />
Passing out may be a sign of a heart attack, and as with other signs or symptoms can occur in isolation or with the other signs mentioned. It may be due to a number of reasons that include a dangerous heart rhythm and low blood pressure. If passing out occurs in a patient with any of the above symptoms, or in a patient with a known history of heart disease, prompt attention is needed.</p>

<p><strong>Signs of a Heart Attack &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; New Palpitations</strong><br />
Although palpitations on their own are not likely associated with a heart attack, those that newly occur in conjunction with chest pain, sweating and shortness of breath combined are certainly concerning. They may represent simply a fast heartbeat in response to the heart attack, or an arrhythmia directly caused by the heart attack such as ventricular tachycardia.</p>

<p><strong>Signs of a Heart Attack &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; Shock</strong><br />
The shock referred to here is the process by where the body is unable to compensate for the affects of the heart attack such as heart failure. This generally means the output of the heart is insufficient in terms of what the body needs. Associated symptoms may be light headed and dizziness, a cool and clammy appearance, fast heart rate and low blood pressure. Shock in general would be associated with a pretty large heart attack.</p>

<p>What To Do If Experiencing Signs of a Heart Attack?<br />
The term time is muscle is very relevant here. In the setting of a heart attack, with each minute that passes there is a chance of increasing and often irreversible heart damage. With quick action heart muscle and lives can be saved. If a heart attack is suspected then an ambulance must be called without delay. The patient needs to be taken to a hospital capable of dealing with a heart attack immediately and action taken. On immediate encounter with a healthcare provider, if a heart attack is suspected then medicine such as aspirin will be given without delay. If a STEMI heart attack is suspected then patients will often need to be taken for heart catheterization immediately, ideally within 60-120 minute of initial symptom onset.</p>

<p><strong>Signs Of A Heart Attack &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; A Summary</strong><br />
Although the classic presentation of a heart attack is chest pain and pressure, radiating to the neck and jaw and left arm with shortness of breath, its important to recognize many patients will have alternative signs and symptoms, especially women. These include back pain, jaw pain, neck pain, nausea, and shortness of breath, palpitations, indigestion, dizziness, and passing out as signs of a heart attack. The most important move if suspecting signs of a heart attack is to call an ambulance without delay as this may well save the life of the person experiencing the heart attack.</p>',

<p>Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye, is an infection or inflammation of the conjunctiva &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; the thin, protective membrane that covers the surface of the eyeball and inner surface of the eyelids. Caused by bacteria, viruses, allergens and other irritants like smoke and dust, pink eye is highly contagious and is usually accompanied by redness in the white of the eye and increased tearing and/or discharge.</p>

<p>While many minor cases improve within two weeks, some can develop into serious corneal inflammation and threaten sight. If you suspect conjunctivitis, visit your eye care provider at Seven Lakes Eye Care for an examination and treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Diabetic Eye Disease</strong></p>

<p>Diabetic eye disease is a general term for a group of eye problems that can result from having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, including diabetic retinopathy, cataracts and glaucoma.</p>

<p>Often there are no symptoms in the early stages of diabetic eye disease, so it is important that you don&acirc;&euro;&trade;t wait for symptoms to appear before having a comprehensive eye exam. Early detection and treatment of diabetic eye disease will dramatically reduce your chances of sustaining permanent vision loss.</p>

<p>Glaucoma</p>

<p>Often called &acirc;&euro;&oelig;the silent thief of sight,&acirc;&euro;&Acirc; glaucoma is an increase in the intraocular pressure of the eyes, which causes damage to the optic nerve with no signs or symptoms in the early stages of the disease. If left untreated, glaucoma can lead to a decrease in peripheral vision and eventually blindness.</p>

<p>While there is no cure for glaucoma, there are medications and surgery available that can help halt further vision loss. Early detection and regular eye exams are vital to slowing the progress of the disease.</p>',

            'description' => '<h2>What is a stroke?</h2>

<p>A<a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/stroke">&nbsp;stroke is a medical emergency</a>. It is similar to a heart attack for the brain. It occurs when the flow of blood to the brain is interrupted, resulting in oxygen starvation to the brain cells which can no longer perform their task whether it is memory, vision or muscle control. The severity of the stroke depends on where the stroke occurs in the brain and how much damage there is. A small stroke can cause a transient and mild weakness of the right hand like in this example where a small area of blurring between the cortex and the white matter on the left side of his brain as displayed on this non-enhanced CT image.</p>

<p>A large stroke can cause a permanent paralysis like in this example of a patient with an occluded right middle cerebral artery and extensive hypodense area of the right hemisphere of the brain on CT images with a resulting paralysis of the whole left side of his body.</p>

<h2>How do you recognize a stroke?</h2>

<p>The most common manifestations of a stroke are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Facial drooping</li>
	<li>Arm weakness</li>
	<li>Slurred speech</li>
	<li>Sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm or leg, especially on one side of the body</li>
	<li>Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech</li>
	<li>Trouble seeing in one or both eyes</li>
	<li>Trouble walking, loss of balance or dizziness</li>
	<li>Sudden severe headache, vomiting and altered consciousness are more common in hemorrhagic or large strokes.</li>
</ul>
